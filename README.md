# Data Structures Assignments

A comprehensive collection of Java-based data structures and algorithms assignments showcasing object-oriented programming principles, inheritance, polymorphism, and the Comparable interface through vehicle management systems and various algorithmic implementations.

## Description

This repository contains 9 assignments covering fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts implemented in Java. The projects demonstrate key programming principles including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
- **Interface Implementation**: Comparable interface for custom sorting
- **Data Structures**: Various data structure implementations and manipulations
- **Algorithm Design**: Problem-solving through algorithmic thinking

## Assignment Overview

### Assignment 1: Vehicle Inheritance System
- **Files**: `Vehicle.java`, `Car.java`, `Motorcycle.java`, `TestVehicles.java`
- **Concepts**: Abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, Comparable interface
- **Description**: Implementation of a vehicle hierarchy with abstract base class and concrete subclasses for cars and motorcycles, featuring sorting capabilities by year.

### Assignment 2: Advanced Vehicle Operations
- **Files**: `Vehicle.java`, `Car.java`, `Motorcycle.java`, `TestVehicles.java`
- **Concepts**: Extended vehicle operations and data manipulation
- **Description**: Building upon Assignment 1 with additional functionality and operations.

### Assignments 3-9
- **Status**: Prepared folders for future implementations
- **Purpose**: Continuation of data structures and algorithms coursework

## Getting Started
