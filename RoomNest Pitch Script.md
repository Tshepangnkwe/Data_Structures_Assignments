# RoomNest Pitch Script.

**[SLIDE 1: HOOK]**

Judges, right now at NWU, students are sharing screenshots from Facebook rental ads and WhatsApp groups—hoping they don't get scammed or find their "perfect room" is already taken. Meanwhile, hosts spend hours every month reconciling through WhatsApp messages, Excel spreadsheets, and manual bank statement checks. After surveying 144 hosts, I found this isn't just inefficient; it's a broken system failing everyone. My name is Tshepang Nkwe, and RoomNest is the solution.

**[SLIDE 2: PROBLEM]**

Meet the victims of this broken system:

- Lesedi, a student risking scams on unverified platforms and struggling to coordinate with potential roommates.
- Mr. Mokoena, a host spending entire evenings chasing late payments instead of spending time with his family.

83% of hosts still use Excel because no platform truly serves their reality.

**[SLIDE 3: SOLUTION]**

RoomNest is an AI-enabled mobile platform that unifies everything—from finding rentals to managing leases, payments, and repairs.

Tenants can:
- ✅ Apply for verified rooms
- ✅ Track leases
- ✅ Submit maintenance requests
- ✅ Split rent with roommates—all in-app
- ✅ Access roommate matching

Hosts get:
- 📈 Digital lease tools, automated rent reminders, tenant screening, and income and expense tracking.

Service providers get:
- 🛠 Job alerts, digital invoices, and direct payments through the platform."

**[SLIDE 4: TARGET MARKET]**

We serve those often ignored:

- 🎓 Students at TVETs and universities drowning in Facebook scams—especially outside metro areas.
- Young professionals: (future expansion as we validate beyond students)
- 🏘️ Hosts managing 1–50 units stuck on WhatsApp.
- 🔧 Informal repair contractors—electricians, plumbers, and handymen—seeking consistent work and payment transparency.

We start with NWU’s 5,000 beds and plan to scale to 5 million renters nationally.


**[SLIDE 5: TRACTION]**

🔥 6 NWU hosts are committed to our October beta.
📊 A 600-host pipeline (2,000+ beds) waiting to onboard.
We’re piloting at NWU with 6 hosts ready to list on RoomNest.

By the end of 2026, we aim for:

- 200 active hosts

Scaling to over 2,500 hosts by 2030.
